# Health Insurance Premium Prediction ( End to End Machine Learning Project )

The venerable insurance industry is no stranger to data driven decision making. Yet in today's rapidly transforming digital landscape, Insurance is struggling to adapt and benefit from new technologies compared to other industries, even within the BFSI sphere (compared to the Banking sector for example.) Extremely complex underwriting rule-sets that are radically different in different product lines, many non-KYC environments with a lack of centralized customer information base, complex relationship with consumers in traditional risk underwriting where sometimes customer centricity runs reverse to business profit, inertia of regulatory compliance - are some of the unique challenges faced by Insurance Business

## Theme of the project
The company wants to automate the health insurance premium charging process (real-time) based on customer detail provided while filling out the online application form. These details are Gender, Age, Number of children, BMI, Smoking habbit,  Income and Area of residence.
